# Pokemon_Cards_Simulator
A card simulator game of the original Pok√©mon cards! 

Pokemon Card Collector was created in order to exhibit and retrain my programming skills right after taking Object Orienting at Florida State University in 2021. It served as a review for concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and building/using a custom dynamic array (vector).This project is show off and retain the knowledge obtained from the object oriented programming course.

This project allows a player to simulate opening pokemon cards and storing them in their binder. It has some fun gimmicks like opening a fire, grass, and
water pack of pokemon cards. Players can view their binder, which presents the information in a nice way. The binder also shows how much their cards are worth. A shiny card has increased worth.
