# Pokemon_Cards_Simulator
A card simulator game of the original Pok√©mon cards! This project is show off my knowledge obtained from object oriented programming.

This project allows a player to simulate opening pokemon cards and storing them in their binder. It has some fun gimmicks like opening a fire, grass, and
water pack of pokemon cards. Players can view their binder, which presents the information in a nice way. The binder also shows how much their cards are worth.

A shiny card has increased worth.
